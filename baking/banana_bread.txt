Banana Bread Recipe

Ingredients

-   3 ripe bananas, mashed
-   1/3 cup melted butter
-   3/4 cup sugar (you can reduce to 1/2 cup for less sweetness)
-   1 egg, beaten
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   Pinch of salt
-   1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Instructions

1.  Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 4x8 inch loaf pan.
2.  In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth.
    Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.
3.  Mix in the baking soda and salt. Add the sugar, beaten egg, and
    vanilla extract, and mix well.
4.  Add the flour and stir until just incorporated. Do not overmix.
5.  Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
6.  Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a tester inserted into the
    center comes out clean.
7.  Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then
    remove the banana bread and let it cool completely on a rack before
    slicing.
